    <h1>Will Artificial Intelligence Replace My Job?</h1>
    <p><em>Exploring AI, automation, and the future of work in the age of intelligent machines.</em></p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>In conversations with friends, the topic of <strong>AI replacing jobs</strong> always emerges. While artificial intelligence has many uses and capabilities, its impact on employment is one of the most pressing and frequently asked questions.</p>

    <p>As someone who started working on <strong>AI engineering</strong> long before ChatGPT existed, I continue with my original vision — avoiding both the hype and the fear. My approach is to examine two factors: <strong>feasibility</strong> and <strong>cost</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How to Determine AI Automation Risk</h2>
    <p>For every occupation, ask:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can it be automated?</li>
      <li>What is the cost compared to human labor?</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jobs Likely Safe from AI in the Near Future</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Work requiring physical movement rather than pure strength.</li>
      <li>Jobs involving high-level representation and human interaction.</li>
      <li>Low-cost employees for employers.</li>
      <li>Positions that demand constant supervision.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Jobs at High Risk of Automation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mainly sedentary and mental work, especially for newcomers or mid-level staff.</li>
      <li>Roles with high total cost to the employer (salary, benefits, training, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Cost Factor in AI Adoption</h2>
    <p>When AI hardware and adaptation costs decrease while output increases, automation becomes more appealing. If the cost of replacing you with AI is lower than keeping you employed, the risk rises significantly.</p>

    <p>For example, in finance, AI can already perform over 70% of certain analyst tasks. In manufacturing, robots like Baxter cost far less to operate than the daily minimum wage in some countries, accelerating adoption.</p>

    <h2>Global Impact: Developed vs Developing Countries</h2>
    <p>Inexpensive labor may delay automation in developing countries, but eventually, production often returns to developed nations where advanced robotics and AI reduce costs further. This trend widens the economic gap.</p>

    <h2>Who Will Remain Safe?</h2>
    <p>Jobs requiring creativity, craftsmanship, or physical presence—like surgery, hairstyling, or dentistry—are harder to automate. If your work can be easily replicated by someone with minimal training, it's at higher risk.</p>

    <h2>A Personal Observation</h2>
    <p>While visiting a European automation machinery company, I noticed that despite their claims of full automation, humans still performed most of the work. This reinforced my belief: if a task cannot fit into a mass production model, AI may not replace it soon.</p>
